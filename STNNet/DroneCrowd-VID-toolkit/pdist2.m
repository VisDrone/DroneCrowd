%
% Calculates the distance between sets of vectors.
%
% Let X be an m-by-p matrix representing m points in p-dimensional space
% and Y be an n-by-p matrix representing another set of points in the same
% space. This function computes the m-by-n distance matrix D where D(i,j)
% is the distance between X(i,:) and Y(j,:).  This function has been
% optimized where possible, with most of the distance computations
% requiring few or no loops.
%
% The metric can be one of the following:
%
% 'euclidean' / 'sqeuclidean':
%   Euclidean / SQUARED Euclidean distance.  Note that 'sqeuclidean'
%   is significantly faster.
%
% 'chisq'
%   The chi-squared distance between two vectors is defined as:
%    d(x,y) = sum( (xi-yi)^2 / (xi+yi) ) / 2;
%   The chi-squared distance is useful when comparing histograms.
%
% 'cosine'
%   Distance is defined as the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
%
% 'emd'
%   Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between positive vectors (histograms).
%   Note for 1D, with all histograms having equal weight, there is a simple
%   closed form for the calculation of the EMD.  The EMD between histograms
%   x and y is given by the sum(abs(cdf(x)-cdf(y))), where cdf is the
%   cumulative distribution function (computed simply by cumsum).
%
% 'L1'
%   The L1 distance between two vectors is defined as:  sum(abs(x-y));
%
%
% USAGE
%  D = pdist2( X, Y, [metric] )
%
% INPUTS
%  X        - [m x p] matrix of m p-dimensional vectors
%  Y        - [n x p] matrix of n p-dimensional vectors
%  metric   - ['sqeuclidean'], 'chisq', 'cosine', 'emd', 'euclidean', 'L1'
%
% OUTPUTS
%  D        - [m x n] distance matrix
%
% EXAMPLE
%  [X,IDX] = demoGenData(100,0,5,4,10,2,0);
